/* afterhours — is the setup repeatable.
   The two files in sql/setup-*.sql are what a person pastes into the
   Supabase editor. Pasting one twice is an ordinary mistake — a lost
   connection, a page reload, a second look at the same tab. If that
   doubles the content, the mistake is expensive and silent.

   So this runs the whole setup twice on a clean database and insists that
   nothing changed the second time.  */
