-- afterhours — real events from Ticketmaster
--
-- Four columns on events, and the deck learns to serve the whole world.
-- The rows themselves are written by backend/tools/sync-ticketmaster.mjs
-- (a daily GitHub Action with the service key); nothing in the browser
-- can write them, the same as every other event.
--
--   source       "seed" for the hand-written nights, "ticketmaster" for
--                the synced ones. The cleanup script and the daily prune
--                only ever touch their own source.
--   external_id  the Ticketmaster id. The sync upserts on it, so a night
--                keeps its uuid between runs and swipes on it survive.
--   image_url    a photograph instead of a drawn poster. The front end
--                shows an <img> when this is set, posters/NN.svg when not.
--   ticket_url   the real ticket page; the button on the event page uses
--                it when it is there.

-- no city, and the deck answers with the whole world, soonest night
-- inside a city block first. Hand-drawn posters keep their own order;
-- synced nights (no poster number) follow, by date.
