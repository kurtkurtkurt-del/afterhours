-- afterhours — the past feed: photos of nights that already happened
-- The bottom of the yours tab is an endless feed, newest first, of past nights:
-- every past night in your city that has a photograph, plus any past night
-- (anywhere) where you or a friend checked in or kept it. Those carry who was
-- there. It is read a page at a time: the app passes the date of the last card
-- it has and gets the next ones.
--
--   past_feed(city, before, before_id, limit)   before + before_id: the last card you have
--
-- Who is named: you, and confirmed friends whose check-in shows to friends
-- (19, show_friends) or who kept the night and keep their kept nights visible
-- (12, kept_visible). Signed out: the nights only, nobody named.
-- Past nights are unpublished by the nightly job (09) but the rows stay; this
-- call reads them, so the feed reaches back a year.
