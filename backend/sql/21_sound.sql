-- afterhours — the sound store
--
-- The background music leaves the app package (14 MB) and streams from a
-- public bucket: sound/<genre>/NN.m4a. Everyone reads; the files are put
-- there once with the service key (backend/tools/upload-sound.mjs).
-- Supabase only: skipped elsewhere, like the poster store.
