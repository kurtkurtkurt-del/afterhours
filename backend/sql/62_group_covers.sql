-- afterhours — a group cover from the shelf (62)
--
-- A group can wear one of the photos the app ships with as its cover (club, crowd,
-- friends), not only a photo uploaded by a member: the path is then preset/<name>
-- instead of <user>/<file>. The app maps the name to its bundled picture; nothing is
-- uploaded. Asked by Ahmet on 12.10.2026 so a group has a face from the first minute.
