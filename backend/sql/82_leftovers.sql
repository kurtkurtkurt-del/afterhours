-- afterhours — a file goes with its row (82)
--
-- The photos bucket is public in the storage sense: whoever holds the address sees
-- the file. Removing a post, a group photo, a cover or a face only ever deleted the
-- row (and the app tried to remove the file from the phone, when it was online and
-- had not crashed); a photo the staff hid stayed served; a deleted account and a
-- pruned guest left their folder behind (F39, 20.10.2026). Decided: the file goes
-- with the row, and a hidden post loses its photo at once. The text stays as the
-- record. Done in the database so that no client is trusted to clean up.
--
--   storage_drop(path)        one object of the photos bucket, service level
--   storage_drop_folder(uid)  everything under a person
-- The triggers below fire on delete, on a replaced path and on hiding. Outside
-- Supabase (the tests) storage.objects may not exist; then there is nothing to drop.
