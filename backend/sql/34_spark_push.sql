-- afterhours — sparks say so: a push when one reaches you, and when someone is in
-- The kinds, their words and the switch (notify_sparks) are in 26_push.sql; this
-- file only adds the triggers, because the sparks themselves come later (27, 28).
--
--   spark      a spark reaches you: you were ticked by name (27), or you are
--              inside the wave it was started for (28). Opens its page.
--   spark_in   someone answered "in" to a spark you started.
--
-- Each goes out once per spark and person (the outbox key), follows the
-- switch, and waits for 09:00 in quiet hours like a friend request does.
-- A wave can be large: the 2nd and 3rd wave count against the same ten a day
-- as the other discovery kinds; the 1st wave (your friends) always goes.

-- "fri 22:00", in the zone of the phone of the person.
