-- afterhours — where a night is, on the map
--
-- Two columns on events and one call. The Ticketmaster sync writes the
-- coordinates of the venue on every upsert (backend/tools/sync-ticketmaster.mjs);
-- the hand-written nights get theirs from the venue table, once, below.
--
--   lat / lng    the venue, WGS84. NULL means "we do not know" — the map
--                leaves the night out, the deck does not care.
--   nights_near  the nights within p_km of a point, nearest first. Same
--                row shape as events_public plus the point and the distance,
--                so the app draws a pin from it directly.
--
-- Szene nights keep their real address behind check-in: the sync never
-- touches them, and whoever enters one by hand should put the district
-- centre here, not the door.

-- Haversine in plain SQL: no PostGIS, no extension to switch on. Good to a

-- goes first so the index does the heavy lifting; the exact distance
-- only runs on what survives it.
