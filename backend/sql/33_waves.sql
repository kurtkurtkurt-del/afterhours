-- afterhours — the waves on yours: nights kept beyond your friends
-- yours has shown two decks above the friends deck with sample cards only:
--
--   2nd wave   nights kept by friends of your friends
--   3rd wave   one step further
--
-- This is the real thing. The walk goes over CONFIRMED friendships only, at
-- most three steps, and keeps the shortest chain to each person, so a card can
-- say who it came through ("you — lina — tarık"). Your own friends are not in
-- it: their keeps are the friends deck already.
--
-- What it shows of someone you do not know: their handle (else their name) and
-- that they kept a night that is still to come. Nothing at all of a person who
-- set kept_visibility to private (12) — and such a person does not carry the
-- chain either, so nobody is named "via" someone who keeps their keeps closed.
--
--   waves_kept(limit)   upcoming nights kept in the 2nd and 3rd wave

-- Everyone within three confirmed steps, the shortest chain to each, starting
-- after you: path[1] is your friend, the last name is the person. Not callable
-- from the app.
