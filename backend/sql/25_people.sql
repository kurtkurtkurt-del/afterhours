-- afterhours — finding people: search and suggestions
-- 07 could only send a request to a handle you already knew by heart.
-- These two calls let the yours tab find someone:
--
--   people_search(q)     by handle or name, as you type
--   people_suggested(n)  a few you may know: the friends of your friends first,
--                        then people in your city
--
-- Both go around the profiles rule (the row of a stranger is closed), so both are
-- definer functions that hand back only the public card: handle, name, city.
-- Nobody hidden by "discoverable = off" appears in either. What someone kept
-- is never used for a stranger: kept nights are for friends only (12).

-- ------------------------------------------------ how you stand with someone
