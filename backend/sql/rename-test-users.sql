-- afterhours — every account except the two that are yours becomes
-- testuser1, testuser2, … in the order they were opened.
--
-- A one-shot for the live database (paste it into the Supabase SQL
-- editor); not a numbered migration, and not part of setup. The handles
-- kept as they are: offdutykurt and kurt2. Everybody else changes handle
-- and display name both; sign-in does not, that is email and password.
-- The handle rule is the one profile_setup enforces: ^[a-z0-9_]{3,20}$,
-- unique. Running it twice is harmless — the numbering is by created_at,
-- so it lands on the same names.
--
-- Two passes rather than one: renaming the first account to testuser1
-- could collide with an account that already carries that handle, and
-- the unique index would stop the whole statement. So every handle that
-- is going to change first moves out of the way, then takes its number.
