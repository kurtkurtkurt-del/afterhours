-- afterhours — the photograph on a profile
--
-- One photograph per person, shown at the top of their account and, to
-- their CONFIRMED friends, wherever the app draws that friend. Nobody
-- else: not a stranger who knows the handle, not someone whose request
-- is still waiting.
--
-- The picture itself lives in the storage bucket "photos", at
-- <user id>/<number>.jpg. What this table keeps is only that path. It is
-- a table of its own and not a column on profiles, because profiles can
-- be read by anyone LINKED to you — a pending request included — and a
-- face is owed to fewer people than a handle is.
--
-- The bucket is public in the storage sense: a file is served to whoever
-- holds its address, without a token, so an <Image> can simply load it.
-- The address is the secret; it is handed out by the rule below and by
-- nothing else, and it changes every time the photograph does.
