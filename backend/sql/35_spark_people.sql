-- afterhours — who answered a spark, by name
-- spark_mine (27, 28) counts the answers; the host could not see WHO. Now:
--
--   spark_people(spark)   names and answers (in first), newest answer first
--
-- Read by the host, and by anyone who is in themselves (people going to the
-- same thing may know who else is going). Someone who said out sees nothing;
-- an unanswered invite is not listed. The name is the handle, else the
-- display name, as everywhere.
