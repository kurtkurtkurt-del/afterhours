/* afterhours — apply the numbered SQL files the live database has not run yet.

   Until 12.10.2026 every file was pasted into the Supabase SQL editor by hand, and
   a project could sit a file behind while everything looked fine (the panel said
   "39, 40 not confirmed" for days). This asks public.migrations which files are in,
   and applies the missing ones from tools/expected-sql.mjs in order, each in its own
   transaction: a file that fails is rolled back and stops the run, the ones before
   it stay in.

     SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgres://… node tools/migrate.mjs           what would run (dry)
     SUPABASE_DB_URL=postgres://… node tools/migrate.mjs --write   run it

   The address: Supabase → Settings → Database → Connection string, "session" mode
   (the direct one, not the transaction pooler: a migration needs a plain session).
   Writing is never automatic: no CI job calls --write; it is a word from a terminal. */
